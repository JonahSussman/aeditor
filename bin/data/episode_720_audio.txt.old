there's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
then school comes along just to end it
so the annual problem for our generation
is finding a good way to spend it
like maybe
building a rocket
or fighting a mummy
or climbing up the eiffel tower
discovering something that doesn't exist
hey
or giving a monkey a shower
surfing tidal waves
creating nanobots
or locating frankenstein's brain
it's over here
finding a dodo bird
painting a continent
or driving your sister insane
phineas
as you can see
there's a whole lot of stuff to do
before school starts this fall
come on perry
so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb
are gonna do it all
so stick with us 'cause phineas and ferb
are gonna do it all
mom phineas and ferb are making a title sequence
