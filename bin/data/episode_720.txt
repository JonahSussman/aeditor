there's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
then school comes along just to end it
so the annual problem for our generation
is finding a good way to spend it
like maybe
building a rocket
or fighting a mummy
or climbing up the eiffel tower
discovering something that doesn't exist
hey
or giving a monkey a shower
surfing tidal waves
creating nanobots
or locating frankenstein's brain
